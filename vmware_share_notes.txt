On host machine:
	Make a folder to share
In VMware Workstation console:
	VM --> Settings --> Options (tab) --> Shared Folder
	Select "Always enabled", then "Add..." and find the folder you made previously
On host machine:
	Open the folder you made to share
In the VM:
	Load the VM
	ls /mnt/hgfs/[shareFolderName]
	touch /mnt/hgfs/[shareFolderName]/test.txt
	verify the file was created on the host machine
	rm /mnt/hgfs/[shareFolderName]/test.txt
	cd
	ln -s /mnt/hgfs/[shareFolderName]/ share
		* there is a space after the shared folder and "share"
		* this makes a symlink at ~/share/ for easy access
