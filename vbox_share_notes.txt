On host machine:
	Make a folder to share
In VirtualBox:
	Load the VM
	Devices --> Shared Folders --> Shared Folder Settings
	Find the folder you made on your host machine, make it auto-mount and permanent
In Linux VM:
	Install Guest Utils
	Make a folder (~/share) to act as the "other end of the pipe" from the host machine
	sudo mount -t vboxsf HostMachineShareFolder ~/YourLinuxShareFolder/
	Reset VM?  Should just work
