#====================
# Basic Usage
#====================

# BASIC CAPTURE
tcpdump -s 0 -nn -i eth0 -w file.pcap
	-s 0 = capture whole packet, instead of first 96 bytes
	-nn = don't try to resolve hostnames or ports
	-i eth0 = capture on eth0
	-w file.pcap = specify output file
	USE CTRL+C TO END CAPTURE

# BASIC CAPTURE ONLY FROM SPECIFIC IP
tcpdump -s 0 -nn -i eth0 'host 192.168.1.1' -w file.pcap
	-s 0 = capture whole packet, instead of first 96 bytes
	-nn = don't try to resolve hostnames or ports
	-i eth0 = capture on eth0
	-w file.pcap = specify output file
	'host 192.168.1.1' = only capture from that IP
	USE CTRL+C TO END CAPTURE

# BASIC CAPTURE ONLY FROM SPECIFIC CIDR
tcpdump -s 0 -nn -i eth0 'net 192.168.1.0/24' -w file.pcap
	-s 0 = capture whole packet, instead of first 96 bytes
	-nn = don't try to resolve hostnames or ports
	-i eth0 = capture on eth0
	-w file.pcap = specify output file
	net 192.168.1.0/24' = only capture from that CIDR
	USE CTRL+C TO END CAPTURE

# CAPTURE AND ROTATE PCAPS EVERY 1 MB
tcpdump -nn -i eth0 -s 0 -C 1 -W 5 -w file.pcap
	-C 1 = rotate files every 1 MB / files will have the same name specified with -w, appending an incrementing number as each file is generated
	-W 5 = limit to 5 rotating files, filenames will have proper leading 0s to allow for sorting
	USE CTRL+C TO END CAPTURE

# CAPTURE AND ROTATE EVERY 3 MINUTES
tcpdump -nn -i eth0 -s 0 -G 180 -W 5 -w file.pcap
	-G 180 = rotate every 180 seconds, filenames won't use the time-appended name format
	USE CTRL+C TO END CAPTURE

# BASIC ASCII OUTPUT FROM FILE
tcpdump -nnAr file.pcap
	-nn = don't try to resolve hostnames or ports
	-A = ASCII output
	-r file.pcap = read from this capture file

# BASIC HEXDUMP OUTPUT FROM FILE
tcpdump -nnXr file.pcap
	-nn = don't try to resolve hostnames or ports
	-A = ASCII output
	-r file.pcap = read from this capture file
	* note that there can't be anything between the "-r" and the filename

# QUIET / SIMPLE OUTPUT, ALSO SEE SINGLE IP OF INTEREST
tcpdump -nnttttq 'host 192.168.1.1' -r file.pcap
	-q = "quiet" / less-noisy output
	-tttt = show both date and time columns, and show them in human readable format
	'host 192.168.1.1' = only show results from that IP (use "net xxxx" for a CIDR)
	* note that there can't be anything between the "-r" and the filename

# SEE ALL HTTP HEADERS
tcpdump -nnAr file.pcap | grep -Po "(GET .*|POST .*|PUT .*|HEAD .*|OPTIONS .*|DELETE .*|TRACE .*|CONNECT .*|HTTP\/[1-2]{1}.*)|^[A-Za-z0-9-]+: .*" | sed -r 's/(GET .*|POST .*|PUT .*|HEAD .*|OPTIONS .*|DELETE .*|TRACE .*|CONNECT .*|HTTP\/[1-2]{1}.*)/\n\1/g'

# SEE ONLY HTTP REQUEST HEADERS
tcpdump -nnAr file.pcap | grep -Po "(GET .*|POST .*|PUT .*|HEAD .*|OPTIONS .*|DELETE .*|TRACE .*|CONNECT .*)|^[A-Za-z0-9-]+: .*" | sed -r 's/(GET .*|POST .*|PUT .*|HEAD .*|OPTIONS .*|DELETE .*|TRACE .*|CONNECT .*)/\n\1/g'

# SEE ONLY HTTP RESPONSE HEADERS
tcpdump -nnAr file.pcap | grep -Po "(HTTP\/[1-2]{1}.*)|^[A-Za-z0-9-]+: .*" | sed -r 's/(HTTP\/[1-2]{1}.*)/\n\1/g'

# TCPDump - Basic Details
#====================

-A = print content of each packet (minus link level header) in ASCII
-X = print content of each packet (minus link level header) in HEX
-t = don't print timestamp
-tt = print epoch timestamp
-ttt = print delta timestamp between current and previous line
-tttt = print date + hours/minutes/seconds/fractions of a second
-ttttt = print delta between current and first line
-n = don't resolve domain names
-nn = don't resolve domain or port names
-q = quiet/simple output
-r = read from file
-s = ONLY ON CAPTURE -- set snaplength (0 = set snaplen equivalent to 65535, aka the whole packet)
-S = print absolute sequence numbers
-U = packet-buffered output, used with -w
-w = output to file
-e = print link-level header on each dump line
-v = verbose output
-vv = more verbose
-vvv =  very verbose

BPF:
host, src a.b.c.d, dst a.b.c.d, net a.b.c.d/24, port x, icmp, portrange x-y, less x, greater y
and (or &&)
or (or ||)
not (or !)
grouping - use parentheses:  tcpdump src 192.168.1.25 and (dst port 21 or 22)

IPv6:
tcpdump ip6

TCP control bits (flags):
#ex. 'tcp[13] & 16!=0'
#tcp[13] looks at offset 13 in the TCP header
# & 16!=0 means look at the bits that aren't 0, or off

UAPRSF
See all packets with x flag set:
URG = tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 32!=0'
ACK = tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 16!=0'
PSH = tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 8!=0'
RST = tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 4!=0'
SYN = tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 2!=0'
FIN = tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 1!=0'
SYNACK = tcpdump 'tcp[13]=18'
# SYN=2, ACK=16, thus SYNACK=18

TCPFLAGS option
tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] & & tcp-syn != 0'

#====================
# TCPDump - Reading/Processing Highlights
#====================

tcpdump -nnAr file.pcap 2>&1
# basic output in ASCII
# 2>&1 suppresses the TCPDump informational lines output

tcpdump -nnttttqr file.pcap 
# don't resolve names, normal timestamp, quiet/simple output

tcpdump -nnAr file.pcap 'host 192.168.1.25'
# capture to/from .25 IP

#====================
# TCPDump - Writing/Capturing Highlights
#====================

TCPDUMP - record to file and display on screen
tcpdump -nn -i eth0 -U -s0 host X and host Y -w - | tee file.pcap | tcpdump -r -
# -U dumps buffer to tee stdin/ pcap immediately, instead of on exit - this is required so you can then read the pcap on screen!
# -w - passes tcpdump to stdout
# tee file.pcap writes to binary file, and sends to stdout
# tcpdump -r - reads from stdout produced by tee, which is a product of the first tcpdump -U
-------
tcpdump tcpdump -nn -i eth0 -s 0 -C 1 -W 5 -w file.pcap
# -C 1 = rotate files every 1 MB / files will have the same name specified with -w, appending an incrementing number as each file is generated
# if used with -G 180 (rotate every 180 seconds), files still won't use the native -G time-appended name format
# if used with -W 5 (limit to 5 rotating files), filenames will have proper leading 0s to allow for sorting

#===================
# TCPDump Permissions
#===================

#============
# Understand what you're doing
#============
man 7 capabilities - overview
focus on CAP_NET...etc
CAP_NET_RAW (use RAW and PACKET sockets, binding for transparent proxying)
|
V
Thread capability sets
File capabilities
--> need CAP_SETFCAP (required to use system capabilities)
(exit man page)

#============
# Assign permissions
#============
setcap
- read man
tcpdump -i eth0 ---> You don't have permission to capture on that device (socket: Operation not permitted)
echo $UID
sudo -i
setcap cap_net_raw=eip /usr/sbin/tcpdump
(eip = effective/inherited/permitted, as seen in man capabilities)
getcap /usr/sbin/tcpdump ---> will output "/usr/sbin/tcpdump = cap_net_raw+eip"
logout (or exit)
tcpdump -i eth0 ---> works!
